Group:
David Akre (netid: dakre)

Xilinx Tool:
Vivado 2017.2

Target FPGA & Speed Grade:
Artix-7 (part xc7a100tcsg324-1) & 155 speed grade
1ns / 1ns timescale

Method used to capture critical path:
Part 2: For all the individual datapath components I ran synthesis and implementation on them and obtained the critical path through the timing reports generated from those options.

Part 3/4:
