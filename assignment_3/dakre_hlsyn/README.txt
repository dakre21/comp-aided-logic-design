Description:
The program has the capability of performing high level synthesis on
a behavioral netlist file per the rubrics specs. The program will
read that input file as the first argument, parse its contents and
perform FDS to layout the HLSM according to the latency constraint (2nd arg),
and generate synthesizable verilog code per the third argument's
file name. After this program completes, it will create a synthesizable
verilog code.
